# Database Normalization Toolkit

## Overview
The Database Normalization Toolkit is a Python-based solution designed to aid in the normalization process of databases. It focuses on determining the synthesis of functional dependencies, identifying candidate keys, and calculating attribute closures in relational databases. This tool is ideal for database administrators, students, and anyone interested in database design and optimization.

## Features
- **Synthesis of Functional Dependencies**: Analyze and extract functional dependencies within a database schema.
- **Candidate Key Identification**: Discover all possible candidate keys that can uniquely identify tuples in a relation.
- **Attribute Closure Calculation**: Compute the attribute closures to understand the attributes functionally determined by a given set of attributes.
